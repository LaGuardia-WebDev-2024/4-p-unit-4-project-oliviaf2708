  <h3>Brooklyn Heights Promenade</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>The Brooklyn Heights Promenade is a walkway overlooking beautiful views of the Manhattan<br>
     Skyline, New York Harbor, and the Brooklyn Bridge. Built in the 1950s, its purpose was to cover<br>
     the BQE out of preservation for the neighborhood, but it now serves as a beautiful, quiet<br> 
     and atmospheric walk lined with historic townhouses, benches and trees. It also has a close<br> 
     proximity to Brooklyn Bridge Park, and a perfectly unobstructed view of the city. It is super<br>
     popular for anything from a nice stroll to rollerblading.<br>
